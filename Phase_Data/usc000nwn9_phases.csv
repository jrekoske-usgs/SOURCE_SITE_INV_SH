#%This file contains information about either a preferred
#%solution for a given earthquake, or a solution from 
#%a particular catalog/network.
#%The header information will consist of the following fields:
#%--------------------------------------------------------------
#%id: The ID for the event from the preferred or specific network.
#%time: The time of the event, always in UTC.
#%location: A string describing the earthquake location.
#%latitude: Earthquake latitude in decimal degrees.
#%longitude: Earthquake longitude in decimal degrees.
#%depth: Earthquake depth in kilometers.
#%magnitude: Earthquake magnitude
#%magtype: Magnitude type (mw,mww,mb,etc.)
#%url:  The ComCat URL where all of the data for this earthquake can be found.
#%*_mrr,mtt,mpp,mrt,mrp,mtp: Moment tensor components (if available) from preferred source (N m).
#%*_np1_strike,dip,rake: Two sets of nodal plane angles for focal mechanism.
#%--------------------------------------------------------------
#%The remaining rows/columns contain the phase data for the event,
#%with the following columns:
#%--------------------------------------------------------------
#%Channel: Network.Station.Channel.Location (NSCL) style station description.
#%         ("--" indicates missing information)
#%Distance: Distance (kilometers) from epicenter to station.
#%Azimuth: Azimuth (degrees) from epicenter to station.
#%Phase: Name of the phase (Pn,Pg, etc.)
#%Arrival Time: Pick arrival time (UTC).
#%Status: "manual" or "automatic".
#%Residual: Arrival time residual.
#%Weight: Arrival weight.
